**Take Note!**

* This project gathers all banned IPs from different server logs and honey pots around the plain and compress them into one compatible file for any <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex-Goaga/Access-Denied/main/includes/pihole-logo.png" alt="Pi-hole" height="24"/> PiHole Project or Synology Auto Block Feature
* Versions the file, and tests, are updated every week 
* Yes, any user can contribute with his honey pot list. ( *With any exception of issues regarding changes to `Access-Denied/main/deny-ip-list.txt`, all other issues regarding the content of the produced hosts files should be made with the appropriate data source that contributed the content in question.

# Unified hosts file additional informations:

* Last updated: **January 02 2021**.
* Here's the [raw hosts file with base extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex-Goaga/Access-Denied/main/deny-ip-list.txt) containing 0,007 entries.

**Expectation**: This host file should serve all devices, regardless of OS ( *with a little thinkering from the end-user* ).

## What is a hosts file?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file
used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`.
Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never
leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware,
and other irritants.

For example, to nullify requests to some doubleclick.net servers, adding these
lines to your hosts file will do it:

```text
# block doubleClick's servers
0.0.0.0 ad.ae.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.ar.doubleclick.net
# etc...
```

## We recommend using `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

Traditionally most host files use `127.0.0.1`, the *loopback address*, to establish an IP connection to the local machine.

We prefer to use `0.0.0.0`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target.

Using `0.0.0.0` is empirically faster, possibly because there's no wait for a timeout resolution. It also does not
interfere with a web server that may be running on the local PC.

## Why not use `0` instead of `0.0.0.0`?

We tried that.  Using `0` doesn't work universally.


## Location of your hosts file

To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor.

**macOS (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, Linux**: `/etc/hosts` file.

**macOS Catalina:** `/private/etc/hosts` file.

**Windows**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` file.

## Please note that :

*  Adding to many entries in the host file ( For example Windows C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts ) in order to block intrusions you can end as a result, on startup, with an initial super-slow connection to the internet. I get the globe icon (no connection) for about 2 minutes on some tests in the Virtual Machine, then it works fine so WE DO RECOMMEND buying a separate machine for the computing DNS process such as a cheap Raspberry Pi 0 (zero) and setup the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex-Goaga/Access-Denied/main/includes/pihole-logo.png" alt="Pi-hole" height="24"/> PiHole Project
